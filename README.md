# BOOTH-MULTIPLIER
The primary advantage of Booth's algorithm is its ability to speed up the multiplication process, especially for numbers with long sequences of 1s. It simplifies the hardware implementation by reducing the number of partial products, making it particularly useful in the design of arithmetic circuits in computer processors
